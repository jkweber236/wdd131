			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site will be to help users track their job applications, including their status and priority level.It will help users stay
            organized with their applications and make the job search process more manageable.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>It is intended for job seekers who need an organized way to manage application details, track their status, and categorize applications based on their level of interest.</p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>To add dynamic elements to the site, I will use Javascript to handle form submission for adding, updating, and removing job applications, with the data being stored for the user.
            Users will also be able to filter, search for, or sort job applications based on a couple factors such as date, priority level, name, company, etc.</p>
